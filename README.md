## Hi there 👋

Hello and welcome! 👋 I’m a React Native developer passionate about creating smooth, responsive, and intuitive mobile user interfaces. This repository is part of my journey into building modern mobile apps using React Hooks and Context API to manage state and behavior in a clean, scalable way.

React Native allows me to bring native mobile experiences to life using JavaScript and React principles. Lately, I’ve been focusing on writing functional components that rely on hooks like useState, useEffect, useContext, and custom hooks to encapsulate logic and make the UI more reactive and modular.

I’m also exploring how to use the Context API effectively to share state across deeply nested components without resorting to prop drilling. This pattern has been especially useful in building features like theming, authentication, and global app settings—all while keeping the codebase organized and easy to maintain.

In this repository, you’ll find examples and mini-projects where I’m practicing UI composition, responsive design, animations, and reusable component patterns. Each project is structured to highlight how hooks and context can be combined to create seamless mobile experiences with less boilerplate and more focus on user interaction.

My goal is to write clear, maintainable code with helpful comments and documentation, so others who are learning React Native or looking for examples can follow along or build on what I’ve started.

If you’re working with React Native, experimenting with hooks, or interested in clean state management patterns, feel free to explore, ask questions, or contribute!

Thanks for stopping by—I’m excited to keep building and learning in the world of mobile development. 📱⚛️🛠️
